  	<p>This current public health crisis demonstrates that we are all interconnected and that our well-being is contingent on that of others. A renewed and healthy society is possible only if governments and public authorities commit to reducing vulnerability and the impact of ill-health by taking steps to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health.It requires that government and nongovernment actors establish policies and programs that promote the right to health in practice.It calls for a shared commitment to justice and equality for all.We have learnt to handle difculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</p>
